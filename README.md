# loadcell-probe
A Z-axis probe for Plasma CNC built on loadcells

## Basic description
The Z-axis stepper motor is mounted on a plate held up by two loadcells. An arduino is then checking the load and direction of load on the loadcells to determine if the Plasma torch is a) touching the table and b) exceeding the boundaries or tilt which causes the limit switch to be flipped.
